# **Week 1: Sentiment Analysis Project**

## **Introduction:**
Welcome to **Week 1** of our **Sentiment Analysis** project! In this project, we aim to analyze the sentiment of text data using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. This README will guide you through the essential terminologies, tools, and libraries we'll be using, including **Jupyter/Colab notebook** environments, **NumPy**, and **Pandas**.

## **Terminologies:**
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Also known as opinion mining, it involves using natural language processing and text analysis techniques to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text.
2. **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms allowing computers to learn and make predictions from data.
3. **Jupyter/Colab Notebook**: Interactive computing environments that allow you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
4. **NumPy**: A powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
5. **Pandas**: A Python library widely used for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and functions to efficiently work with structured data.

## **Tools and Libraries:**
1. **Jupyter/Colab Notebook**: We'll be using Jupyter or Google Colab notebooks to write and execute our code interactively. These notebooks provide a convenient environment for experimentation and collaboration.
2. **NumPy**: We'll leverage NumPy for numerical computations, especially for handling arrays and matrices efficiently.
3. **Pandas**: Pandas will be used extensively for data manipulation, including loading, cleaning, and transforming our dataset.

## **Getting Started:**
**Setting Up Environment**:
   - If you haven't already, install Jupyter Notebook or set up a Google Colab account.
   - Ensure NumPy and Pandas are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:
     ```
     pip install numpy pandas
     ```
